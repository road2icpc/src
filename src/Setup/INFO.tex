\subsubsection*{How to submit/debug}

Remember:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fast input.

	\item Unsure of time limit? Generate simple max cases!

	\item Check memory limits.

	\item Check overflow!

	\item Turbo mega check the right file gets submitted.

	\item Compile (and run test cases) at least once with \texttt{dc}; strongly consider resolving warnings.

	\item Overflow?

	\item Make sure you are reading e.g. $n$ and $m$ in the right order.

	\item Do not have uninitialized variables!

	\item If WA/RE: print code. Take a quick walk. Maybe even rewrite everything. RE can mean MLE. Invalidated pointers/iterators?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{During test session}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{setxkbmap dk/us}.

	\item That bashrc/vimrc works.

	\item Printing.

	\item Sending clarification.

	\item \texttt{cppreference}.

	\item CLI submission if it exists.

	\item Whitespace sensitivity in submissions.

	\item Return non-zero from main.

	\item Printing to \texttt{stderr} during otherwise correct submission.

	\item Source code size limit (if not stated by jury).

	\item Get MLE and check if it shows as RE.

	\item Check compile time limit.

	\item \texttt{\_\_int128}.

	\item Check available binaries (yoinked from kactl): \texttt{echo \$PATH | tr ':' ' ' | xargs ls | grep -v / | sort | uniq | tr '\\n' ' '}
\end{itemize}
