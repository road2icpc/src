//# Title: Topological Sort
//@ Description: [kactl] Topological sorting. Given is an oriented graph.
//@  Output is an ordering of vertices, such that there are edges only from left to right.
//@  If there are cycles, the returned list will have size smaller than $n$ -- nodes reachable
//@  from cycles will not be returned.
//@ Complexity: $O(|V|+|E|)$
